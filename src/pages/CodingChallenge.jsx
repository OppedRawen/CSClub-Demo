            <p>
                In each session, we prepare one or two specific programming questions. Contrary to competition-style coding, these workshops are meant to enrich everyone's knowledge and hone their skills in expressing solutions, especially for interview preparations. It's a collaborative environment where everyone actively communicates their solutions and understanding of the challenges presented.
