                Guest lectures have always been an integral part of our offerings. We've been fortunate to host professionals from the industry, as well as esteemed professors from IVC, like Professor Salvani and Professor Zhai, a Senior Developer at Blizzard. These experts share invaluable insights about their respective fields, offering a glimpse into their day-to-day career experiences. This year, we aim to scale up this initiative by inviting even more professionals from the industry.
