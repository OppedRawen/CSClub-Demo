                The IVC computer science club dedicates a significant amount of its time introducing new concepts to members. 
                Discussions revolve around various frameworks, common data structures, and specific algorithm questions that could be encountered during interviews. 
                The club aims to delve deeper than the typical school curriculum, incorporating concepts from Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. 
                Emphasis is also given to platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are projected to be highly relevant in the future.
